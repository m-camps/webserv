## General Information
- The primary role of the web server is to store, process and deliver requested information to the end users.
- By building a web server, we could gain a deep understanding of the HTTP protocol, websockets and the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).


## Technologies Used
- C++98
- Python3
- HTML5
- CSS

## Features
- HTTP requests: GET, POST, DELETE 
- File upload via POST request
- CGI - displaying a page via the python interpreter
- Directory listing

- Python3 (/usr/local/bin/python3)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Config file


## Usage
